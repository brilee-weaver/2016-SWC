    <p> As the popular vote counts from each state were reported, into the early morning hours of Nov. 9, 2016, voters and non-voters alike watched as maps on their television and computer screens evolved into the expected electoral patchwork of red and blue. And, come 3:00 a.m., candidate Donald Trump became president-elect Trump, in what has been called the most controversial election in modern history.</p>
    <p> But in the days and weeks following the Republican victory, as vote counts continued to climb and the gap between Trump and opponent Hillary Clinton's total popular vote counts widened, questions and frustrations about the significance of the electoral college bubbled over in public spaces both in person and online.</p>
    <p> What, in fact, is the electoral college? And, more importantly, how has its influence impacted our present and our future?</p>
    <p> Step into the Big Top; we're juggling two vote counts and walking the tight rope that connects two very different Americas.</p>

    <p> No, you can't graduate from the electoral college. In this case, "college" refers to a group of people dedicated to a common task.</p>
    <p> When the average American heads to the election polls, they are voting to elect certain people, known as "electors," to the college. Electors are appointed by the politcal parties in each state. Each state gets a certain amount of electors based on its population.</p>
    <p> This year, the electors will cast their votes on Dec. 19, the the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December. </p>
    <p> It takes at least 270 electoral votes to win the presidency. There are 538 electoral votes in all. </p>

    <p> In the history of the United States, there have been five incidents when the president-elect won the electoral vote but lost the popular vote. </p>
    <p> In 1824, Andrew Jackson won the popular vote but eventually lost the election to John Quincy Adams. In 1876, Samuel Tilden won the popular vote but lost the electoral vote to Rutherford B. Hayes. In 1888, Grover Cleveland lost that year's election to Benjamin Harrison despite winning the popular vote.</p>
    <p> In 2000, Al Gore won the popular vote by more than a half a million votes but, after a Supreme court decision that ended a recount of votes in Florida, lost the presidency to George W. Bush. </p>
    <p> And, in 2016, two weeks after election day, the popular vote count for Hillary Clinton reached 64.2 million votes- two million votes ahead of president-elect Trump's 62.2 million votes. Despite this gap in the popular vote, Clinton lost the election with a total of 232 electoral college votes compared to Trump's 306.</p>

    <p> "I have poured countless hours into serving the party of Lincoln and electing its candidates. I will pour many more into being more faithful to my party than some in its leadership. But I owe no debt to a party. I owe a debt to my children to leave them a nation they can trust.</p>
    <p> The election of the next president is not yet a done deal. Electors of conscience can still do the right thing for the good of the country. Presidential electors have the legal right and a constitutional duty to vote their conscience. I believe electors should unify behind a Republican alternative, an honorable and qualified man or woman such as Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. I pray my fellow electors will do their job and join with me in discovering who that person should be.</p>
    <p> Fifteen years ago, I swore an oath to defend my country and Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. On Dec. 19, I will do it again."</p>
    <p> Christopher Suprun's "Why I Will Not Cast My Electoral Vote for Donald Trump," which appeared in the New York Times last week, looks ahead to Dec. 19 and offers a glimmer of hope for both Democrats and Republicans dissatisfied with Trump's election to presidency.</p>
    <p> Van Jones looks even farther ahead, beyond Dec. 19 to an America under Trump, and calls for a Love Army to bridge the gap between a polarized America: "We're pushing people away from us by saying, 'If you voted for him then you're no better than his worst utterances.' You're giving away people who probably felt very conflicted voting for him. We need to build a bridge of respect, and part of it starts with actual dialogue.'"</p>
